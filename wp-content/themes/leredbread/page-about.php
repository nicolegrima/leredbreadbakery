                  <p>Le Red Bread’s staff is made up of an amazing team of inspired bakers.
                    We really know our stuff when it comes to muffin tins and stand-up mixers.
                    We also brew a mean cup of coffee.</p>

            <h2 class="about-subtitle">Our Story</h2>

            <p>Le Red Bread has been Vancouver baked-good icon for more than two months!
              Customers often comment on the bustle of activity they see in the bakery behind the cafe…
              that’s where the magic happens every day.</p>

            <p>Our day begins at the crack of dawn and we start baking almost immediately.
              Cookie and muffin batters that were prepared the night before are poured into tins
              and popped in the ovens, bread dough rises and gets popped into the oven, and pretzels are crossed.</p>

            <p>By breakfast time we’re open for business and greeting our first customers,
              pouring coffees as we serve delectable treats.</p>

            <p>We’re committed to continuing the Le Red Bread tradition in Vancouver and we still
              produce our fabulous range according to the original recipes passed down from generations of
              master bread artisans.</p>
